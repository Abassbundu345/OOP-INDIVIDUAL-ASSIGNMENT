 README.txt — Mini Library Management System
 
Project Overview:
This Python-based Mini Library Management System allows users to manage book records using a menu-driven interface. It supports core CRUD operations — adding, viewing, searching, updating, and deleting books — stored in a list of dictionaries.

Features:
Add new book records with ISBN, Title, Author, Publisher, Genre, and Quantity
View all books in the system
Search for books by keyword
Update book details by ISBN
Delete books by ISBN
Input validation and error handling
Automated test suite using `unittest`



 File Structure:
library_system.py` → Main application logic
test_library_system.py` → Unit tests for all core functions
uml_diagram.png` → UML class diagram of the system
demo_script.txt` → Step-by-step user interaction demo
README.txt` → Project documentation

 How to Run:
1. Open the project in PyCharm or any Python IDE.
2. Run `library_system.py` to launch the menu interface.
3. Follow on-screen prompts to perform operations.


 How to Test:
1. Ensure both `library_system.py` and `test_library_system.py` are in the same folder.
2. Right-click `test_library_system.py` in PyCharm.
3. Select **Run 'test_library_system'**.
4. All tests should pass with green checkmarks.


 UML Diagram:

Future Enhancements:
Add member management and borrowing logic
Save/load book data using JSON or CSV
Convert to class-based OOP design
Add GUI using Tkinter or web interface using Flask
